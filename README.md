Overview
This repository contains the code and data for EDA Final Report: Key Drivers of California's Air Quality Challenges. The project investigates the primary contributors to poor air quality in California over the past decade, focusing on PM2.5 as the pollutant of interest. The analysis examines trends and correlations between air quality and three key drivers: wildfires, vehicle usage, and energy consumption.

Project Objectives
Analyze PM2.5 levels: Understand how air quality has changed over the past 10 years.
Identify key contributors: Investigate the impact of wildfires, vehicle usage, and energy consumption on PM2.5 levels.
Provide insights: Inform policy suggestions for improving Californiaâ€™s air quality.
